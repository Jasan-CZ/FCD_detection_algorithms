# "Detection of Focal Cortical Dysplasia Type II in Children: A Comparative Analysis of Imaging-Based Algorithms and Neuroradiological Assessment"
m-codes and bash code of FCD Detection Algorithms

FCD detection algorithms:
- CORTICAL THICKNESS images
- JUNCTION (Blurring) images
- EXTENSION images

INPUT: T1w structural data in sufficient (sub/milimeter) resolution

Freesurfer and Mathworks Matlab needed
